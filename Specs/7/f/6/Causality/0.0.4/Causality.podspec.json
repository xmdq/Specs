  "description": "Causality is simple in-memory event bus for Swift. Events may have an\nassociated message and are fully typed. All publish/subscribe methods are\nthread-safe.\n\nIn addition, Causality has provisions for monitoring State information. State\nis similar to Event, but differ in that:\n\nState handlers will be called immediately with the last known good value (if\none is available) State handlers will not be called if the state value is\nidentical to the previous value Whereas an Event has an associated Message, a\nState has an associated Value.  A state's Value must conform to the Equatable\nprotocol.",
