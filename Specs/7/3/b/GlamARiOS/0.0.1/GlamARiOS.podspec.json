  "description": "With GlamAR iOS SDK, you can apply different SKUs such as lipstick, blush, eyeliner and eyeshadow. **Note :- You can only apply SKUs that you’ve already configured in the Admin Panel. **With the GlamAR SDK, you can take snapshots of the preview, change the makeup opacity and even capture a video recording. Because the GlamAR SDK can apply makeup in real-time, you can use it in applications such as displaying your shop’s cataolgue.",
