  "description": "Pull to refresh is an essestial feature for almost every mobile app but unfortunately it is not that easy.\nAlso it have some limitations and its own set of bugs which comes with it. Code duplication is one of the main reason which motivated me to work on this library.\n\nInspired by the `DSL pattern` and how easy it is to use i.e. how `SnapKit` does it, this library also uses the same pattern.\nThe magic key word is `ptr` to access all your `PullToRefresh` properties/methods.",
