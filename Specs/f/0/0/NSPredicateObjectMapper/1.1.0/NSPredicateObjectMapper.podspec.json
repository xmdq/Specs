  "summary": "Wrapper build above NSPredicate adding object access to NSManagedObjects and request chaining.",
  "description": "Writing magic strings of NSPredicate is not optimal, I've wanted the same experience from Core Data as for example C# has from LINQ in EntityFramework. Objective access guards types you can or can't operate with, suggests only relevant operation choices after every request in the chain and of course removes a possibility of typos. Framework is lightweight, written in Swift and well documented.",
