  "summary": "ReAnimation is a library for working with animations declaratively via RxSwift framework.",
  "description": "This library is intended to cut out unnecessary boilerplate from UIView.animate by encapsulating the animations in declarative constructs which can be plugged into a RxSwift pipeline.\n\nFor example, animating the origin along with the scale is as simple as using\n```\ntarget.rx.animate(\n    ReactiveAnimations.Scale(factorX: 3, factorY: 3, duration: duration)\n        .simultaneously(with: ReactiveAnimations.Move(originX: 1, originY: 1, duration: duration))\n)\n```",
