  "summary": "Swift library that implements the Crestron CIP protocol.",
  "description": "This Swift module was inspired by Katherine Lenae's Python CIP client.\n\nThis is a Swift-based socket client that facilitates communications with a Crestron control processor using the Crestron-over-IP (CIP) protocol. Familiarity with and access to Crestron's development tools, processes and terminology are required to configure the control processor in a way that allows this module to be used.\n\nA sample Swift app and Crestron program are posted on GitHub.",
