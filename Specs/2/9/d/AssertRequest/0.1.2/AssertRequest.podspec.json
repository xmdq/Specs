  "description": "Assert Request allows you to assert that your app is making the correct network request in a given situation, without any setup.\nThis framework works like a snapshot test. First, you run it on record mode, so every request made during test time is stored on disk. Later, when you disable recording, the framework will assert that matching requests will be made for that same test case.\nDuring test time, no requests will be actually made to the web.",
