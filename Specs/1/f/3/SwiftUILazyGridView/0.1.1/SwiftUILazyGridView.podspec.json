  "description": "A pod that acts as an Array datasource and processor for items being displayed. Use this pod\nwhen you need a quick and dirty Grid View with fixed columns and support for different orientations.\n\nThe pod is designed using a MVVM approach. This avoids shortcomings of SwiftUI where it is not \ndirectly possible to perform lazy loading without alot of States and Publishing.\n\nThis pod takes care of all that for you. You simply need to provide the Raw and Processed types,\nprocess if needed and provide a view builder closure. You're done!",
