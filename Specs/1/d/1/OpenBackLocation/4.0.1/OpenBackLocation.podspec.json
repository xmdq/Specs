  "description": "OpenBack\n========\n\n# OpenBack iOS SDK – Making every app more engaging every day.\n\n![Logo](https://docs.openback.com/images/logo_cocoapods.png)\n\nOpenBack is a smart push notification solution for mobile apps.  This SDK library makes it easy for your native app to start using OpenBack.\n\nThe OpenBack solution enables mobile apps to reliably deliver push notifications every time as well as controlling the moment of delivery for each user.\n\nOpenBack enables this by working locally on the device, based on cloud side message campaigns and settings, by building on local notifications.\n\n# Resources\n\n- [OpenBack Docs](https://docs.openback.com/ios/integration)\n- [Getting started guide](https://docs.openback.com)\n- [Sample Application](https://github.com/OpenbackLtd/OpenBack-iOS-SampleApp)\n\n# Installation\n\n- Xcode 10.0+ is required for the library and all projects. The projects must target iOS9 and above.\n- See OpenBack’s documentation for full details on [native iOS SDK setup here](https://docs.openback.com/ios/integration) or just go ahead and add to your Podfile:\n\n````ruby\npod 'OpenBack'\npod 'OpenBackLocation'\n````\n\nMake sure you have the Cocoapods dependency manager installed.\n\n# Support\n\nPlease use live chat from [docs.openback.com](https://docs.openback.com) or [dashboard.openback.com](https://dashboard.openback.com]), or email us at integrations@openback.com with any questions or feature requests."
