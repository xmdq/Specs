  "description": "Designers love to make beautifully custom page controls that fit in with all the wood,\ngradients, and inner shadows they've worked so hard perfecting.\n\nWho can blame them?! NAPageControl makes it dead simple to give them what they want. Even\nbetter, NAPageControl is a drop in replacement for UIPageControl. It mirrors all the functions\nof UIPageControl, with literally no changes beyond the class name.",
