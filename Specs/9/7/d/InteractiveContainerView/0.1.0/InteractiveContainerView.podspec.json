  "description": "The container view tracks the movements of fingers and applies zooming, scrolling and rotation accordingly.\nThe rotation and zooming respect gesture location (pivot point), scrolling supports deceleration and is limited so the content will never leave the visible area of the screen.\nThe container has a delegate which allows you to respond to the content transformations events.",
