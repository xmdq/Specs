  "description": "`ElegantColorPalette` is inspired by [TimePage](https://us.moleskine.com/timepage/p0486) and is part of a larger repository of elegant demonstrations like this: [TimePage Clone](https://github.com/ThasianX/TimePage-Clone).\n\nThe top level view is an `SKView` that presents an `SKScene` of colors nodes. The color nodes are `SKShapeNode` subclasses. When using this library, you are only interacting with the `SKView`: all you have to do is configure the size of the view either through autolayout or size constraints and the view does the rest.",
