  "description": "This is a simple 3rd-party library of open weather maps APIs which includes only two APIs - One Call weather data and Direct Geocoding. It handles the response data of API calls and decode the data to objects using JSONDecoder and Decodable. A API call returns the response objects with RxSwift, that the type of response objects is Observable<ResponseObject> and you can subscribe the observable response object and bind it to an UI element.",
